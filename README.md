# 2025Reefscape
Hello, I am Athena and I am one of your mentors. I started an outline for 2025Reefscape and if you could look at it sometime this week to get familiar with it, that will be awesome. I am usually here Friday nights and occasionally on Saturdays. I have some tasks for you guys listed below for you to complete in the meantime.
## Tasks to do:
- Look through previous code (2023 or 2024) on GitHub and work on Swerve code
- Work on subsystem and command based code (referring to previous documents on GitHub is a great way to start if you are stuck)
## Tips:
- WPILIB API

- Third Parties Libraries

- Comments are VERY important so other programmers can understand what you have worked on
- Remember to assign appropriate numbers to your CANIDs (it will help a lot with organization)
